# Path-To-Oblivion Privacy Policy 

Path To Oblivion does not collect or store any user or sensitive data (beyond simple things like in-game statistics or achievements). 

Path To Oblivion calls Google API for in-app purchases. After some search online and reading some Google documentation, I could not clearly determine whether this counts as sharing financial data. When I coded it, I simply made an API call; I do not directly handle any financial data (it is handled indirectly through the Google API).
